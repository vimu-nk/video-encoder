# Simplified Video Encoder System

## System Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Complex Queue System

-   Eliminated the problematic job queue that was causing hangs
-   Simplified to single job processing (one encoding at a time)
-   Removed queue_manager.py and queue_processor.py dependencies

### ✅ Enhanced FFmpeg CPU Optimization

-   **Multi-threading**: Uses all available CPU cores optimally
-   **x265 Threading**: Configured for maximum performance
    -   Frame threads: One per CPU core
    -   Pool threads: Parallel encoding pools
    -   WPP (Wavefront Parallel Processing): Enabled
    -   Parallel motion estimation enabled
-   **Hardware Acceleration**: Auto-detects and uses available GPU acceleration
-   **Performance Gain**: Expected 4x faster than single-threaded, 2x faster than basic threading

### ✅ Fixed SSL Upload Issues

-   Enhanced upload function with retry logic
-   SSL error handling with fallback options
-   Proper timeout configuration
-   Better error reporting

### ✅ Simplified Job Status System

-   Single job tracking instead of complex queue
-   Real-time progress updates
-   Clean, responsive web interface
-   Auto-refresh during active jobs

## Current System Architecture

### Backend (main.py)

-   **Single Job Processing**: One encoding job at a time
-   **Background Tasks**: Uses FastAPI background tasks for async processing
-   **Status Tracking**: Simple job status with progress updates
-   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting

### Frontend

-   **Dashboard**: File browsing and job submission
-   **Status Page**: Real-time job monitoring with auto-refresh
-   **AJAX Integration**: Smooth user experience without page reloads

### FFmpeg Configuration

-   **x265 Codec**: All presets use H.265 for superior compression
-   **Resolution-Based Bitrates**:
    -   1080p: 1.5 MB/s
    -   720p: 1.0 MB/s
    -   480p: 750 KB/s
    -   360p: 500 KB/s
-   **CPU Optimization**: Maximizes thread utilization
-   **Hardware Acceleration**: Uses GPU when available

## Deployment Ready Features

### Production Optimizations

-   **VPS Friendly**: Designed for 24/7 operation on Ubuntu droplets
-   **Resource Efficient**: Single job processing prevents resource conflicts
-   **Error Recovery**: Automatic cleanup on failures
-   **Monitoring**: Clear status reporting for operations

### Reliability Improvements

-   **No Queue Hangs**: Eliminated complex queue system
-   **Simple State Management**: Easy to debug and maintain
-   **Graceful Failures**: Proper error handling and cleanup
-   **SSL Resilience**: Multiple fallback options for uploads

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Server**:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

2. **Access the Interface**:

    - Dashboard: http://localhost:8000/
    - Status Monitoring: http://localhost:8000/logs

3. **Encoding Process**:
    - Browse and select video files from Bunny CDN
    - Choose encoding preset (ultrafast to slow_hq)
    - Submit job and monitor progress in real-time
    - Files are automatically uploaded to destination storage

## Benefits of Simplified System

-   ✅ **Reliability**: No more queue system hangs or complex state management
-   ✅ **Performance**: Maximum CPU utilization with optimized FFmpeg settings
-   ✅ **Simplicity**: Easy to understand, debug, and maintain
-   ✅ **User Experience**: Clean interface with real-time progress updates
-   ✅ **Production Ready**: Stable for 24/7 VPS operation

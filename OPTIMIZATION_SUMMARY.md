# FFmpeg Encoding Optimization

## Problem Solved

The original FFmpeg configuration was using H.265 with "slow" preset, which resulted in extremely slow encoding times. This was causing user complaints about performance.

## Solution Implemented

Created a flexible preset system with 6 different encoding options optimized for speed vs quality:

### Preset Options

1. **Ultra Fast** (`ultrafast`)

    - Codec: H.264 (libx264)
    - Speed: ‚ö° Fastest possible encoding
    - Use case: Quick tests, previews
    - Trade-off: Lowest quality, larger file sizes

2. **Super Fast** (`superfast`)

    - Codec: H.264 (libx264)
    - Speed: üöÄ Very fast encoding
    - Use case: Development, quick turnaround
    - Trade-off: Good balance for testing

3. **Very Fast** (`veryfast`)

    - Codec: H.264 (libx264)
    - Speed: ‚ö° Fast encoding with decent quality
    - Use case: Regular production work
    - Trade-off: Minor quality reduction

4. **Fast** (`fast`) - **DEFAULT & RECOMMENDED**

    - Codec: H.264 (libx264)
    - Speed: ‚úÖ Optimal balance of speed and quality
    - Use case: Most production scenarios
    - Trade-off: Best overall compromise

5. **Medium** (`medium`)

    - Codec: H.264 (libx264)
    - Speed: ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced approach
    - Use case: When quality is more important than speed
    - Trade-off: Slower but better quality

6. **Slow HQ** (`slow_hq`)
    - Codec: H.265 (libx265) - Original slow method
    - Speed: üéØ Slowest but highest quality
    - Use case: Final master copies, archival
    - Trade-off: Significant time investment

## Performance Improvements

**Before**: H.265 "slow" preset - Could take hours for large files
**After**: H.264 "fast" preset (default) - **5-10x faster encoding**

### Speed Comparison (estimated):

-   Ultra Fast: ~20-30x faster than original
-   Super Fast: ~15-20x faster than original
-   Very Fast: ~10-15x faster than original
-   **Fast: ~5-10x faster than original** ‚Üê Default choice
-   Medium: ~3-5x faster than original
-   Slow HQ: Same as original (for quality comparison)

## Technical Optimizations Applied

1. **Codec Switch**: libx264 (H.264) instead of libx265 (H.265)

    - H.264 has better hardware support
    - Much faster encoding times
    - Still excellent quality for most use cases

2. **Preset Optimization**: "fast" instead of "slow"

    - Significantly reduces encoding time
    - Minimal quality impact for most content

3. **Threading**: Using all available CPU cores (`-threads 0`)

4. **Audio Handling**: Copy audio without re-encoding (`-c:a copy`)

5. **Web Optimization**: `+faststart` flag for streaming-friendly files

## Usage

Users can now select their preferred preset from the dashboard dropdown:

-   **Fast** is selected by default (recommended)
-   Users can choose **Ultra Fast** for quick tests
-   Users can choose **Slow HQ** when quality is critical

## Deployment Ready

The optimized encoder is now ready for production deployment on your Ubuntu droplet with:

-   Much faster encoding times
-   User-selectable quality levels
-   Maintained compatibility with existing infrastructure
